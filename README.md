Basic packages to extend Sauros functionality

To install packages, ensure that the SAUROS_HOME environment variable is set, and that `libsauros` is installed on the target system.

Since this is the development variant of the packages, they will need to be built so `cmake` and a `c++` compiler must be installed.

The packages can be built and installd automatically via `install.py`. To install a specific package, run `install.py <package-name>`
